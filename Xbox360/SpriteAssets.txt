Theme
The sprites should have a campy cartoony feel to them. 
Ideally I would like them to be somewhere around the quality 
that would have been expected in a SNES game (super mario world-ish).
All of them should have 60x60 pixel frames and should come close
to filling the frames (I want things to look a little bit chubby).
