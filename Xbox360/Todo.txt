Bugs

Pushed Bugs
- make super bubbles work for wrapping the screen
- super bubbles pop when jumping on them sometimes
- enemies can pop in invisible areas when they time out above the screen

Test


Balance Issues
- Adjust the amount of ammo per pick-up (much less grape gum)
- Adjust the chew cost per shot (shooting should be more expensive)
- Balance check all the levels to make sure they are playable
- Enemies need to pop out of bubbles faster (possibly configurable)
- Adjust the damage for different hits
- Adjust the health for fruit
- Adjust the speed that enemies shoot at
- Adjust how long items take to expire
- Adjust points for fruit
- Adjust how many points for a new life



Future Ideas (v2)
- Build level designer
- make a "plungerbot" that walks around platforms
- make a ghost bot that can fly through walls soemtimes
- make a durabot that has multiple lives
- make seaker bot that has smart pathfinding (will have to run on a separate thread)
- add effect to flash white when getting a crystal ball
- Animated foregrounds / backgrounds
- Add in bosses
- tutorial level to teach people how to play
- add fireworks to the congratulations screen
- Orange gum that goes through walls
- Gum that you can ride inside of (force field gum?)
- Bad items that make you

	- loose your special abilities
- Add a new special item that increases the lethal duration of your shots (use bubble icon)
- Add health bar that displays next to character after life changes
- Add in behavior for when the players are taking too long on a level
- Add animations for stuck robots (trying to break out)
